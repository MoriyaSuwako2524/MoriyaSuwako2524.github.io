The number of basis functions sets the number of molecular orbitals. However, not all orbitals are chemically relevant. Typically only the occupied orbitals and low-lying virtual orbitals have real chemical significance. If basis functions are chosen as atomic orbitals, the expansion is called the <strong>Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO)</strong>.

During the SCF procedure, these coefficients remain unchanged. What evolves through the SCF iterations are the <strong>molecular orbital expansion coefficients</strong>, which are optimized until convergence.</p><hr><h3 id="1-5-Shells">1.5 Shells</h3><p>In basis set terminology, a <strong>shell</strong> refers to a group of Gaussian type functions (GTFs) that share the same angular momentum but differ in their Cartesian form.<br>For Cartesian GTFs, the shell structures are:</p><ul><li><strong>S shell:</strong> S</li><li><strong>P shell:</strong> X, Y, Z</li><li><strong>D shell:</strong> XX, YY, ZZ, XY, XZ, YZ</li><li><strong>F shell:</strong> XXX, YYY, ZZZ, XXY, XXZ, YYX, YYZ, ZZX, ZZY, XYZ</li><li><strong>G shell:</strong> XXXX, YYYY, ZZZZ, XXXY, XXXZ, YYYX, YYYZ, ZZZX, ZZZY, XXYY, XXZZ, YYZZ, XXYZ, YYXZ, ZZXY</li></ul><p>…and so on for higher angular momenta.</p><hr><p>In practice, a contracted basis function is formed by contracting multiple primitive GTFs.<br>Thus, a basis set shell can also be constructed by contracting a set of <strong>primitive shells</strong>.</p><p>Within a given shell, all functions share the same contraction coefficients and Gaussian exponents.<br>Therefore, in real basis set definitions, shells are often specified as a unit rather than listing each function separately.</p><h2 id="II-Basis-Sets">II. Basis Sets</h2><p>There are many different types of basis sets, such as <strong>6-31G*</strong>, <strong>def2-TZVP</strong>, and <strong>cc-pVTZ</strong>.</p><p>Each basis set specifies, for every atom, the types of shells to be used, along with the contraction coefficients and Gaussian exponents. The parameters of a basis set can be determined in several ways. For example, one can fit Slater-type orbitals (STOs), or optimize against certain atomic or molecular properties such as ionization energies, electron affinities, or atomic excitation energies. Basis sets can also be constructed by using special schemes like <strong>even-tempered exponents</strong>.</p><p>Different basis sets vary in reliability, size, and computational cost. A well-designed basis set balances accuracy with efficiency: it should be large enough to provide good results, but not so large that the computation becomes prohibitively expensive. It is worth emphasizing that you cannot compare the energies in different basis sets.<br>For problems requiring high accuracy, one often needs to employ systematically improvable basis sets that converge toward the complete basis set limit.</p><h4 id="Example-Basis-Set-Definition-for-Carbon-in-Gaussian-Format">Example: Basis Set Definition for Carbon in Gaussian Format</h4><p>The table below shows how a basis set is defined for carbon in the Gaussian program format.</p><ul><li><strong>Shell type (S, P, …)</strong></li><li><strong>Contraction degree</strong> (number of primitive GTFs combined)</li><li><strong>GTF exponent</strong> (α values)</li><li><strong>Contraction coefficients</strong> (d values)</li></ul><p>Example:</p><figure class="highlight apache"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs apache"><span class="hljs-attribute">S</span> <span class="hljs-number">3</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>.<span class="hljs-number">00</span><br><span class="hljs-attribute">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">4464510</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">03</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">197880</span>E-<span class="hljs-number">01</span><br><span class="hljs-attribute">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">6746260</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">02</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">145340</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">00</span><br><span class="hljs-attribute">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">1506700</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">02</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">185290</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">00</span><br><br><span class="hljs-attribute">S</span> <span class="hljs-number">3</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>.<span class="hljs-number">00</span><br><span class="hljs-attribute">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">6746260</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">02</span> -<span class="hljs-number">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">999100</span>E-<span class="hljs-number">02</span><br><span class="hljs-attribute">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">1506700</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">02</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">285190</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">00</span><br><span class="hljs-attribute">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">2999100</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">01</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">566280</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">00</span><br><br><span class="hljs-attribute">S</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>.<span class="hljs-number">00</span><br><span class="hljs-attribute">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">2999100</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">01</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>.<span class="hljs-number">000000</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">00</span><br><br><span class="hljs-attribute">P</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>.<span class="hljs-number">00</span><br><span class="hljs-attribute">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">4367700</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">01</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">116710</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">00</span><br><span class="hljs-attribute">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">8698200</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">00</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">475580</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">00</span><br><br><span class="hljs-attribute">P</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>.<span class="hljs-number">00</span><br><span class="hljs-attribute">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">1883900</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">00</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>.<span class="hljs-number">000000</span>E+<span class="hljs-number">00</span><br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="2-1-Minimal-Basis-Set">2.1 Minimal Basis Set</h3><p>A <strong>minimal basis set</strong> assigns only <strong>one basis function</strong> to each atomic orbital (AO). This makes the basis very compact, but also too small to fully describe core and valence orbitals in real molecules. Therefore, minimal basis sets are rarely used in modern quantum chemistry. The most well-known minimal basis sets are the <strong>STO-nG</strong> series introduced by Pople. In these, each Slater-type orbital (STO) is approximated by a linear combination of <strong>n Gaussian type functions (GTFs)</strong>. The notation “nG” means that each STO is replaced by n Gaussians.</p><p>The most common example is <strong>STO-3G</strong>. STOs resemble real atomic orbitals, but integrals with STOs are difficult to compute. In contrast, integrals involving GTFs can be evaluated efficiently.  However, a single Gaussian does not reproduce the radial behavior of an STO very well, especially in the region close to the nucleus where the cusp is important. Therefore, a linear combination of several GTFs is used to approximate one STO. This is the principle behind the STO-nG minimal basis sets.</p><p>The figure below shows the radial behavior of a 1s STO compared to its Gaussian approximations:</p><ul><li><strong>SLATER:</strong> true Slater-type orbital</li><li><strong>STO-1G:</strong> single Gaussian approximation</li><li><strong>STO-2G:</strong> contraction of two Gaussians</li><li><strong>STO-3G:</strong> contraction of three Gaussians</li></ul><img src="D:\calculate\github\QchemTutorials\notebooks\03-qchem\pngs\STO.png" alt="STO" style="zoom:25%;" /><h3 id="2-2-Extended-Basis-Sets">2.2 Extended Basis Sets</h3><p>Compared with minimal basis sets, <strong>extended basis sets</strong> use more than one basis function to represent each atomic orbital.</p><p>If each valence orbital is described by <em>n</em> basis functions, the basis set is called an <strong>n-zeta basis set</strong>.<br>A widely used example is the <strong>Pople 6-31G series</strong>, which is a <strong>double-zeta (DZ) basis set</strong>.</p><hr><h4 id="Example-6-31G">Example: 6-31G</h4><ul><li>The <strong>core orbitals</strong> are represented by one contracted basis function formed from six primitive Gaussians.</li><li>Each <strong>valence orbital</strong> is described by two basis functions:<ul><li>One contracted function composed of three primitives.</li><li>One uncontracted single primitive.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Thus, 6-31G is a <strong>double-zeta (DZ)</strong> basis set.<br>An extended version, <strong>6-311G</strong>, uses one contracted function of three primitives plus two uncontracted functions for each valence orbital, making it a <strong>triple-zeta (TZ)</strong> basis set.</p><p>In the 6-31G and 6-311G families, the <strong>core orbitals</strong> are represented by a single contracted function.<br>The contraction degree is very high, but since core orbitals are relatively rigid, their shape and energy hardly change in molecules. Therefore, it is sufficient to describe them with a single contracted function. In contrast, <strong>valence orbitals</strong> are much more flexible. They change significantly during chemical bonding, and their shapes may be distorted in molecular environments. Thus, multiple basis functions are needed for valence orbitals. For example, in bonding and anti-bonding situations, splitting the valence description allows the basis set to capture such variations more accurately.</p><p>Minimal basis sets fail to capture the flexibility of valence orbitals, leading to poor accuracy. Extended basis sets, with split-valence functions, provide a much more reliable description of molecular electronic structure.</p><hr><h3 id="2-3-Polarization-Functions">2.3 Polarization Functions</h3><p><strong>Polarization functions</strong> are additional basis functions with angular momentum higher than that of the highest occupied atomic orbital.<br>For example:</p><ul><li>For hydrogen, $p$ functions are polarization functions.</li><li>For oxygen, $d$ functions are polarization functions.</li><li>For iron (Fe), $f$ functions are polarization functions.</li></ul><p>Polarization functions are usually <strong>uncontracted</strong>.</p><p>Adding polarization functions allows the basis set to describe distortions of atomic orbitals in molecular environments. This is essential for obtaining accurate molecular properties, especially for atoms that are important in bonding. In Hartree–Fock and correlated methods, polarization functions greatly improve the flexibility of the wavefunction. They allow the basis set to reproduce features such as <strong>bond polarization</strong> and <strong>cusp behavior</strong> near nuclei. Without polarization functions, calculations systematically underestimate bond dipoles and fail to capture angular distortions.</p><h3 id="2-4-Diffuse-Functions">2.4 Diffuse Functions</h3><p><strong>Diffuse functions</strong> are basis functions with very small exponents (close to zero).<br>They extend very far into space, and are usually uncontracted.</p><hr><h4 id="When-diffuse-functions-are-useful">When diffuse functions are useful</h4><ul><li>Calculation of <strong>dipole moments</strong> and <strong>higher multipole moments</strong></li><li>Description of <strong>anions</strong> and <strong>Rydberg excited states</strong></li><li>Calculation of <strong>vertical ionization energies</strong>, <strong>electron affinities</strong>, and <strong>excitation energies</strong></li><li>Description of <strong>weak intermolecular interactions</strong> (van der Waals, hydrogen bonding)</li><li>Calculation of <strong>Raman</strong> and <strong>ROA intensities</strong></li><li>More accurate <strong>reaction energies</strong> and potential energy surfaces</li></ul><hr><h4 id="When-diffuse-functions-may-not-help">When diffuse functions may not help</h4><ul><li>For systems with no strong polar character, diffuse functions do not necessarily improve results.</li><li>Adding diffuse functions increases computational cost and sometimes only brings marginal improvements.</li></ul><p>The <strong>3-zeta basis set</strong> family (e.g., triple-zeta) often already includes diffuse functions in its design.  The <strong>4-zeta basis set</strong> family almost always requires diffuse functions to be added explicitly.</p><hr><h4 id="Problems-Introduced-by-Diffuse-Functions">Problems Introduced by Diffuse Functions</h4><ul><li><strong>Significant increase in computational cost</strong></li><li>SCF convergence becomes much more difficult</li><li>Some wavefunction analysis methods may fail (e.g., <strong>Mayer bond order</strong>, <strong>Mulliken population analysis</strong>)</li><li>May <strong>destroy chemical interpretability</strong> of virtual orbitals (loss of clear valence character)</li><li>Sometimes produce <strong>unstable eigenvalues</strong> in calculations</li><li>Can lead to <strong>reduced symmetry</strong> in wavefunctions and molecular structures due to numerical issues</li></ul>]]></content>

Founded in 1993, it is developed by a broad community of contributors. Within the CCATS group, Q-Chem serves as the primary platform for method development and production calculations.</p><h2 id="1-Q-Chem-overview">1.<strong>Q-Chem overview</strong></h2><p>Q-Chem is a general-purpose electronic-structure package offering broad coverage from HF/DFT to advanced correlated and multireference methods. As of <strong>August 23, 2025</strong>, the latest release is <strong>Q-Chem 6.3</strong>.</p><p><strong>Core capabilities (selected)</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Ground-state SCF (HF/ROHF/UHF):</strong> analytic gradients/Hessians, robust optimizers, and property analysis.</li><li><strong>Density Functional Theory:</strong> semilocal → double-hybrid functionals; energies, geometry optimizations, and vibrational analyses; TDDFT including spin-flip variants for challenging excitations.</li><li><strong>Post-HF correlation:</strong> MP2 family (incl. OO/RI/dual-basis, MP3), coupled-cluster (CCSD, CCSD(T)) and a wide EOM-CC suite (EE/SF/IP/EA), plus ADC methods.</li><li><strong>Strong correlation &amp; active-space options:</strong> CASSCF/CAS-CI, RAS-CI/RAS-SF, CCVB/PP, and spin-flip DFT.</li><li><strong>Excited states (broad toolbox):</strong> CIS, CIS(D), TDDFT/SF-TDDFT, ΔSCF via MOM/SGM, NOCI/NOCIS, EOM-CC, ADC; support for core-level excitations (CVS).</li><li><strong>Embedding &amp; extended systems:</strong> stand-alone <strong>QM/MM</strong>, CHARMM interface, <strong>QM/EFP</strong>, and modern dielectric/embedding models.</li><li><strong>PES exploration &amp; optimization:</strong> constrained and unconstrained optimizations (minima/TS), IRC paths, and relaxed scans.</li></ol><p><strong>Performance &amp; parallelism</strong><br>Q-Chem supports OpenMP threading, MPI for distributed-memory runs. Usually one should run with $2^n$ numbers of cores. I ran some benchmark of the parallel jobs:</p><p><img src="D:%5Ccalculate%5Cgithub%5CQchemTutorials%5Cnotebooks%5C03-qchem%5Cpngs%5Cparallel1.png" alt="parallel1"></p><p>Figure 1. Parallel benchmarking of Q-Chem on the test molecule. Three tasks(single-point (SP), force, and vibrational frequency) were run with 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 CPU cores on PETE. Speedup is computed from wall time relative to the 2-core run. According to the Figure, adding more cores won’t give proportional speeds.</p><h2 id="2-Install-Compile-Q-chem">2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Quantum Chemistry Theory Basic</h1><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> This part is for a quick introduction to Quantum Chemistry. For a more comprehensive study, I recommend <em>Modern Quantum Chemistry</em> by Szabo.</p></blockquote><p>Quantum chemistry calculations face the central challenge of solving the Schrödinger equation for many-body systems. Because the Schrödinger equation is too complex to be solved exactly, in practical numerical calculations various approximations are always introduced to reduce computational complexity and cost. Common approximations include:</p><ul><li>Born–Oppenheimer approximation</li><li>Finite basis set approximation</li><li>Single-electron approximation, electron correlation approximations</li><li>Relativistic approximations</li><li>Approximations in numerical accuracy of computation</li></ul><p>In most cases, the accuracy of quantum chemistry calculations depends critically on two aspects: the theoretical method and the basis set.</p><h2 id="I-Born–Oppenheimer-BO-Approximation">I. Born–Oppenheimer (BO) Approximation</h2><p>To rigorously solve the Schrödinger equation of a molecular system, both electrons and nuclei must be treated quantum mechanically, which makes the problem very complex:</p><p>$$<br>\hat{H}<em>{\text{tot}} , \Psi</em>{\text{tot}}(\mathbf{R}; \mathbf{r})<br>= E_{\text{tot}} , \Psi_{\text{tot}}(\mathbf{R}; \mathbf{r})<br>$$</p><p>Since nuclear masses are much larger than electron masses, quantum effects of nuclei are much smaller than those of electrons. The BO approximation is one of the most important approximations in quantum chemistry. It separates nuclear and electronic motions, thereby reducing the complexity of solving the molecular Schrödinger equation:</p><p>$$<br>\Psi_{\text{tot}}(\mathbf{R}; \mathbf{r})<br>= \Psi_{\text{nuc}}(\mathbf{R}) , \Psi_{\text{ele}}^{(\mathbf{R})}(\mathbf{r})<br>$$</p><hr><h3 id="1-1-Electronic-Schrodinger-Equation">1.1 Electronic Schrödinger Equation</h3><p>Under the BO approximation, when solving the electronic wavefunction, the nuclear positions are regarded as fixed parameters. Thus, the BO approximation is also referred to as the fixed-nuclei approximation.</p><p>For each set of nuclear coordinates $\mathbf{R}$, the corresponding electronic energy $E_{\text{ele}}(\mathbf{R})$ can be obtained by solving the electronic Schrödinger equation. This energy is called the potential energy or potential energy surface (PES) under the BO approximation:</p><p>$$<br>\hat{H}<em>{\text{ele}}^{(\mathbf{R})} \Psi</em>{\text{ele}}^{(\mathbf{R})}(\mathbf{r})<br>= E_{\text{ele}}^{(\mathbf{R})} \Psi_{\text{ele}}^{(\mathbf{R})}(\mathbf{r})<br>$$</p><p>To describe nuclear motion, one must further solve the nuclear Schrödinger equation, which includes the nuclear kinetic energy operator and the interaction potential:</p><p>$$<br>\left[ \hat{T}<em>{\text{nuc}} + E</em>{\text{pot}}(\mathbf{R}) \right]<br>\Psi_{\text{nuc}}(\mathbf{R})<br>= E_{\text{tot}} \Psi_{\text{nuc}}(\mathbf{R})<br>$$</p><hr><h3 id="1-2-Beyond-the-BO-Approximation">1.2 Beyond the BO Approximation</h3><p>For directly solving the nuclear + electronic system, using the BO approximation to obtain the nuclear wavefunction and $E_{\text{tot}}$, the following corrections may be introduced:</p><ol><li><strong>Non-adiabatic correction</strong>: This introduces the non-adiabatic coupling matrix elements (NACME), which describe the coupling between different electronic states and nuclear motion.</li><li><strong>Diagonal correction</strong>: The diagonal part corresponding to NACME, used to correct the coupling between a single electronic state and nuclear motion; this contribution is usually small.</li><li><strong>Mass polarization correction</strong>: Arising from the coupling between the internal motion of the electrons and the center-of-mass motion of the nuclei.</li></ol><p><em>For details, see</em> <em>Introduction to Computational Chemistry</em> (3rd edition), Section 3.1.</p><hr><h3 id="1-3-Diagonal-Born–Oppenheimer-Correction-DBOC">1.3 Diagonal Born–Oppenheimer Correction (DBOC)</h3><p>When no strong intersection of two potential energy surfaces occurs, the BO approximation is often very reasonable. Errors in the electronic part of the calculation are mainly due to the neglect of nuclear motion. If further corrections are required, one can add the <strong>Diagonal Born–Oppenheimer Correction (DBOC)</strong> to the electronic energy:</p><p>$$<br>\Delta E_{\text{DBOC}} =<br>\sum_A^{\text{atoms}}</p><ul><li>\frac{1}{2M_A}<br>\left\langle \Psi_{\text{ele}} \middle| \nabla_A^2 \middle| \Psi_{\text{ele}} \right\rangle<br>$$</li></ul><p>In molecular dynamics simulations involving nuclear motion, potential energy surfaces alone are not sufficient; one must also consider the coupling between electronic and nuclear motion. The <strong>non-adiabatic coupling matrix elements (NACME)</strong> then become particularly important. In such cases, although the BO approximation provides a useful starting point, the electronic Schrödinger equation must often be solved repeatedly with explicit inclusion of NACME terms.</p><h2 id="II-Electron-Correlation">II. Electron Correlation</h2><p>In practical quantum chemical calculations, the molecular Hamiltonian is written as:</p><p>$$<br>\hat{H}_{\text{ele}}^{(\mathbf{R})}<br>= \sum_i \left[ -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_i^2 - \sum_A \frac{Z_A}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{R}_A|} \right]</p><ul><li>\sum_{i&gt;j} \frac{1}{r_{ij}}</li><li>\sum_{A&gt;B} \frac{Z_A Z_B}{|\mathbf{R}_A - \mathbf{R}_B|}<br>$$</li></ul><p>where the terms correspond to <strong>electron kinetic energy</strong>, <strong>electron–nucleus attraction</strong>, <strong>electron–electron repulsion</strong>, and <strong>nucleus–nucleus repulsion</strong>. The first bracketed part is the <strong>one-electron part</strong>.</p><hr><h3 id="2-1-Electron–Electron-Interaction-in-Terms-of-Density">2.1 Electron–Electron Interaction in Terms of Density</h3><p>The electron–electron interaction can also be expressed in terms of the electron density, which provides a more intuitive physical picture:</p><p>$$<br>E_{ee} = \left\langle \Psi \middle| \sum_{i&gt;j} \frac{1}{r_{ij}} \middle| \Psi \right\rangle<br>= \iint \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}<em>2)}{r</em>{12}} , d\mathbf{r}_1 d\mathbf{r}_2<br>$$</p><p>The two-particle density can be decomposed as:</p><p>$$<br>\rho(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2) =<br>[\rho^{\alpha\alpha}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2) + \rho^{\beta\beta}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2)]</p><ul><li>[\rho^{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2) + \rho^{\beta\alpha}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2)]<br>= \rho^{\uparrow\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2) + \rho^{\uparrow\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2)<br>$$</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Same-spin pair density</strong><br>$$<br>\rho^{\uparrow\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2)<br>= \Gamma^{\uparrow\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2)<br>= \rho^{\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_1) \rho^{\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_2) + \Gamma_X^{\uparrow\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2)<br>$$</li><li><strong>Opposite-spin pair density</strong><br>$$<br>\rho^{\uparrow\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2)<br>= \Gamma^{\uparrow\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2)<br>= \rho^{\uparrow}(\mathbf{r}_1) \rho^{\downarrow}(\mathbf{r}_2)<br>$$</li></ul><hr><h3 id="2-2-Exchange-and-Coulomb-Correlation">2.2 Exchange and Coulomb Correlation</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Exchange correlation ($X$)</strong>: Arises from the Pauli exclusion principle (antisymmetry of the electronic wavefunction). This reduces the probability of finding two same-spin electrons close to each other. The corresponding energy lowering is the <strong>exchange energy $E_X$</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Coulomb correlation ($C$)</strong>: Due to Coulomb repulsion, electrons tend to avoid each other even beyond exchange effects, lowering the probability of electron–electron co-location. This further reduces the system energy, corresponding to the <strong>correlation energy $E_C$</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>Thus, electron correlation effects beyond exchange are essential to capture long-range Coulomb avoidance. Approximations neglecting this (e.g., Hartree–Fock) miss correlation energy, which must be included for quantitative accuracy.</p><hr><h3 id="Example-H-2">Example: $H_2$</h3><p>Consider the hydrogen molecule:</p><ul><li><strong>Correlation hole</strong>: If one electron is known to be at a certain position, the probability of finding another electron nearby is reduced due to exchange and correlation effects.</li><li><strong>Fermi hole</strong>: Reflects the Pauli principle; the minimum value is 0, showing that the probability of finding two same-spin electrons at the same position is zero.</li><li><strong>Coulomb hole</strong>: Arises from Coulomb repulsion; the distribution shifts slightly to avoid close encounters even for opposite-spin electrons.</li></ul><p>Graphically, the <strong>total hole</strong> can be seen as a combination of the <strong>Fermi hole</strong> and <strong>Coulomb hole</strong>, shifting electron density to reduce repulsion.</p><h2 id="III-Classification-of-Common-Theoretical-Methods">III. Classification of Common Theoretical Methods</h2><ul><li><strong>Semi-empirical methods</strong> (e.g., Semi-empirical, DFTB, GFN-xTB)</li><li><strong>Density functional theory (DFT)</strong></li><li><strong>Hartree–Fock (HF)</strong></li><li><strong>Perturbation theory</strong></li><li><strong>Coupled cluster (CC)</strong></li><li><strong>Configuration interaction (CI)</strong></li><li><strong>Multiconfigurational self-consistent field (MCSCF)</strong></li><li><strong>Multireference methods</strong> (e.g., MRCI, CASPT2)</li><li><strong>Molecular mechanics (MM, non-quantum chemistry)</strong></li></ul><p>Among them, <strong>ab initio</strong> methods are those derived directly from first principles without empirical parameters. In practice, computational chemistry often balances accuracy and computational cost.</p><p>DFT is currently the most widely used method because it achieves a balance between efficiency and accuracy. Although not as rigorous as wavefunction-based <em>post-HF</em> methods, DFT is still a mainstream tool.</p><h3 id=""></h3>]]></content>
